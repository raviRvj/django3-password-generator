    <br>
    <p>Hello there.</p>
    <p>My name is Ravi Raj and I am a software engineer. I am currently working for US based MNC company.</p>
    <p>I have been working on Mainframe Systems but deep down I have great desire to learn Python, Machine Learning
    and also the Python frameworks along with the front-end and backend technologies. I also have a bachelors
    degree in INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY from SRM University (now, SRM institute of Science and Technology).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I feel great having found out this course to have knowledge of Django to proceed further
    in my learnings as well as career.
    </p>
